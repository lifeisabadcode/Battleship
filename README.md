# Battleship
Battleship game (Python 2.7)

I'm a total programing noob, I just started to learn to code. On Codecademy
there's an exercise where you build a battleship and this is my improvement
and I would like some opinions on how can I improve and maybe check for
mistakes. Keep in my mind I started programming week ago.
